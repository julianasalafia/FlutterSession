# I am Rich

![I am Rich](https://github.com/julianasalafia/FlutterSession/blob/main/Screenshots_Projects/i_am_rich.png)

This code displays a diamond image on a blue-grey background. The `main` function creates a `MaterialApp` with a `Scaffold` that has a blue-grey background, an `AppBar` with the title "I am Rich" centered, and a blue-grey background color. The body of the `Scaffold` is a `Center` widget with an `Image` child that displays an asset image of a diamond. The image is specified using the `AssetImage` class and the path to the image file.
