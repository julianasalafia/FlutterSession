# Columns and Rows

![Columns and Rows](https://github.com/julianasalafia/FlutterSession/blob/main/Screenshots_Projects/columns_and_rows.png)

This code displays three colored containers in a row. The `MyApp` class extends `StatelessWidget` and overrides the `build` method to create a `MaterialApp` with a `Scaffold` that has a teal background and a `SafeArea` containing a `Row`. The `Row` is stretched to fill the available space, spaced evenly, and contains three children: a red `Container`, a `Column` with two children, and a blue `Container`. The `Column` is centered and contains two children: a yellow `Container` and a light green `Container`. All the containers have the same width and height.
