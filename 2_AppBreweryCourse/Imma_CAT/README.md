![Imma cat](https://github.com/julianasalafia/FlutterSession/blob/main/1_Screenshots/imma_cat.png)

This app displays an image of a cat and a text message on an indigo background. The `main` function creates a `MaterialApp` with a `Scaffold` that has an indigo background, an `AppBar` with the title "this is a real cat" centered, and no elevation. The body of the `Scaffold` is a centered `Column` with two children: a centered `Image` widget that displays an asset image of a cat, and a `SizedBox` with a height of 16 followed by a `Text` widget that displays the message "Hello! Imma real cat." in white using the "Exo2" font family and a font size of 24.
